# GT Thrift Shop

The idea our team has is making a mobile application for GT Thrift Shop. This idea came from our experience using Facebook GT thrift shop group page. We, as a team, believe that a mobile application, with improvement and newly added features such as meet-up navigation/on-campus meeting reservation system and direct photos uploads, will make it more convenient for GT students to sell/buy used goods.
