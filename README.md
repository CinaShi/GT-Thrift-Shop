# GT Thrift Shop

The idea of our team is to make a mobile application for GT Thrift Shop. This idea came from our experience using Facebook GT thrift shop group page. We believe that a mobile application, with improvement and newly added features such as rating and comments system, instant message and direct photos uploads, will make it more convenient for GT students and faculties to sell or buy used goods. Additionally, integrating GT authentication into the app will make our app a much safer choice for GT students.

## Install Guide

### Pre-requisites and Download Instruction:

- For developers:

> This project requires Mac OS system, Xcode 8 and Swift 3 to run. Normally if you are using a Mac system already, simply downlaod the [latest version of Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from App Store and open `GTThriftShop.xcworkspace` in `frontend` folder. 

- For future customers:

> After this app launches in App Store in the future, customers will be able to download it directly from App Store on iPhone. This app currently requires iPhone version of at least 10.0 and iPhone model no earlier than iPhone 6. 

### Dependent Libraries and Trouble-shooting(for developers):

> Normally to run this project there's no need to download any other dependent libraries since all dependent ones have been included. But if when running the app Xcode shoots troubles of any third-party libraries missing, try re-install CocoaPods by running following line in `frontend` folder from Terminal:

```sh
$ pod install
```
### Run Instruction(for developers):

> To run this project in Xcode, you can either use Xcode's built-in iPhone simulator or, if you have an Apple developer account already, connect your device to your Mac and test running the app on your device.
